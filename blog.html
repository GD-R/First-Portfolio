            I am normal guy trying to get job in Development especially in Web Development. I graduated in the year 2016 as a Computer Science Engineer and currently I am working as PMO in CGI Organization.<br>
            I first started my career as PMO in the year 2016 which was going well at the beginning but later I realized that this PMO job is not for me, but sad part is by the time I realized it was 2.5 years down the line and by the end of 2019 I tried to move out of PMO domain because I always had some passion for technical side and the PMO is kind of non-technical. I then taught of learning some programming language and did some research and started with JAVA and got familiar with Basics of JAVA. <br>
            I tried moving to technical role within the company but my experience in PMO was a barrier. And I learnt that getting a Job outside in Development field is very taught without an experience. I was very frustrated and really wanted to move completely out of PMO. I then decided very late to try Web Development. I came across many online courses and also, I stated learning from YouTube. I decided that I want to build my skills in Web Development and build some good Projects. Recently I came across bootcamp https://neog.camp/ from Instagram and after checking out this bootcamp I was excited to join. I followed the Level 0 lessons and watched related videos and I think I have gained good knowledge of Web Development. Finally, I am here and hopefully everything will go well in future.<br>
            Thank You NeoG Camp for helping me in learning Web Development.<br>

            Hello, I will discuss some basic fundamental about JavaScrip
            Language. JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used
            language in various fields.
          </p>
          <p>How to Define a Variable:</p>
          <p>
            You need to first delcare a variable and intialize the value. To
            declare a variable you can use two keywords <b>let</b> or
            <b>const</b> <br />For Example: let num = 5 <br />here let is a
            keyword, num is a variable name and 5 is the value assigned to
            variable num. When ever if you wish to change the value of variable
            you can simply write <b>num = 10 </b> so the new value of variable
            num will be 10. When const keyword is used insted of let then the
            value assigned during the intialization can not be changed through
            out tht program. <br />For Example: const num = 5; <br />When const
            is used and in future if you try to change the value of num it will
            throw an error. <br />
            Value of the variable can be anything like integer, word, char or
            sentences. Below are the ways to difine differnt datatypes. <br />
            To define word the Value must be quoted within the double or single
            quote. <br />
            let name = "JavaScript"; <br />
            The value of name is JavScript <br />
            For single character we define as let a = "A"; <br />
            Similarly for sentence let sen = "Hello World"; <br />
            One more Important fact you need to know about JavaScript is that
            you can end the line with or without semilcolan i.e <br />
            let num = 5; and let num = 5 both are same.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a Interpreted Language, All the Browser we use comes
            with inbuilt JavaScript engine to execulte the JavaScript code.
